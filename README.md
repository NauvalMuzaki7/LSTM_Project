JKSE Stock Index Close Price data using stationarity handling modeled using the five methods, the best model for predicting validation data is to use the Bidirectional LSTM method with an RMSE value of 41.94 and an MAE value of 32.61.

Meanwhile, JKSE Stock Index Close Price Data without using stationarity handling modeled using the five methods, the best model for predicting validation data is to use the Bidirectional LSTM method with an RMSE value of 26.26 and an MAE value of 20.44. Meanwhile, to predict the next 4 periods (days) of data, the best model is the Vanilla LSTM model with an RMSE value of 37.21 and MAE of 28.72.
