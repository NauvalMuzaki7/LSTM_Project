With the SVR (Support Vector Regression) method, the best model is obtained, namely a model with a linear kernel, Cost 100, and Epsilon (e) 0.01 with a model fit value of R-Square 99.25856% and MAPE 4.89308 in training and R-Square 92.92418% and MAPE 2.387365 in testing. Then after forecasting for the next 100 periods, it appears that the JKSE stock price will increase over the next 100 periods. From the results of this experience, it can be used as material to make choices to stock buyers whether to buy JKSE shares or not.
